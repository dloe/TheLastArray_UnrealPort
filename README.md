## Original Game Synopsis:
The Last Array is a roguelike, survival, dungeon crawler where the player must survive an unforgiving world. The main objective is to reactivate the last array, but to do so, you must manage your resources wisely. The game’s levels are randomly generated to provide a new experience each time the player starts. Being a survival game, there is a big focus on resource management as that will be the ultimate reason for your survival.
